# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis-

##Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the CompetitionOne metric that people are interested in when it comes to vehicles is horsepower. Horsepower is a common performance metric that is reported alongside car fuel-efficiency and engine size. Therefore it would be really easy to collect horsepower data for a large number of vehicles. We can create a study that tests whether or not the horsepower of MechaCar is statistically different from a collection of other comparable vehicles. The null hypothesis would be that there is no statistical difference between MechaCar horsepower and the horsepower of all other comparable vehicles. The alternative hypothesis would be that there is a statistical difference between horsepower of MechaCar versus the other vehicles. The statistical test we can use is a one-sample t-test, where the population data will be all comparable vehicles. To test this, we will need multiple horsepower data points from vehicles as well as multiple data points from the MechaCar vehicles, so it will be important that we include the horsepower of multiple vehicle configurations.
